    <h1>How aircraft speed is measured</h1>

    <p>
      Measuring speed in an aircraft is very different from measuring speed in a car.
      While cars measure how fast they move relative to the ground,
      aircraft primarily measure how fast they move relative to the air.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">The pitot-static system</h2>

    <p>
      Aircraft speed is measured using the <strong>pitot-static system</strong>,
      which relies on air pressure rather than rotating wheels or GPS.
    </p>

    <h3>Dynamic pressure</h3>
    <p>
      When an aircraft moves through the air, the airflow creates pressure.
      The faster the aircraft moves, the higher the pressure generated.
      This is called <strong>dynamic pressure</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Static pressure</h3>
    <p>
      Static pressure is the atmospheric pressure at the aircraft’s altitude.
      It decreases as altitude increases.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>
        The airspeed indicator works by measuring the difference between
        total pressure (pitot pressure) and static pressure.
        This difference gives us the dynamic pressure,
        which is directly related to speed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>The pitot tube</h3>
    <p>
      The pitot tube is a small forward-facing tube located on the fuselage or wing.
      It captures the total pressure (static + dynamic).
      Separate static ports measure only atmospheric pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      The airspeed indicator then calculates speed from the pressure difference.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Types of airspeed</h2>

    <h3>IAS – Indicated Airspeed</h3>
    <p>
      This is the speed shown directly on the cockpit instrument.
      It does not account for instrument errors or air density variations.
    </p>

    <h3>EAS – Equivalent Airspeed</h3>
    <p>
      IAS corrected for instrument and compressibility errors.
      It is mostly relevant at high speeds.
    </p>

    <h3>TAS – True Airspeed</h3>
    <p>
      The actual speed of the aircraft relative to the air mass.
      Since air density decreases with altitude,
      TAS increases with altitude for the same IAS.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>
        At high altitude, an aircraft may show 250 knots IAS,
        but its true airspeed could be over 400 knots.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>GS – Ground Speed</h3>
    <p>
      Ground Speed is the aircraft’s speed relative to the ground.
      It depends on wind:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tailwind increases ground speed</li>
      <li>Headwind decreases ground speed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Ground speed is typically measured using GPS systems.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Why cars measure speed differently</h2>

    <p>
      Cars measure speed by counting wheel rotations.
      A sensor calculates how many times the wheels spin
      and converts that into speed based on tire circumference.
    </p>

    <p>
      This works because cars move in contact with the ground.
      Aircraft, however, move through air, not along a surface.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>
        For an aircraft, aerodynamic forces depend on airspeed,
        not ground speed. Lift is generated by airflow over the wings,
        so knowing speed relative to the air is critical.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Interesting facts & curiosities</h2>

    <h3>Pitot icing accidents</h3>
    <p>
      If the pitot tube becomes blocked by ice,
      the airspeed indicator can provide incorrect readings.
      This has contributed to several aviation accidents.
      Modern aircraft use pitot heating systems to prevent icing.
    </p>

    <h3>The “coffin corner”</h3>
    <p>
      At very high altitudes, the difference between stall speed
      and maximum operating speed becomes very small.
      This dangerous region is known as the coffin corner.
    </p>

    <h3>Supersonic flight</h3>
    <p>
      At high Mach numbers, air compressibility significantly affects
      pressure readings, which is why Mach number indicators
      are used in addition to traditional airspeed indicators.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      Aircraft speed measurement is based on physics,
      specifically pressure differences and air density.
      Unlike cars, airplanes must measure speed relative to the air
      because lift, drag and overall flight safety depend on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding the difference between IAS, TAS and GS
      is fundamental in aviation and highlights how complex
      flight truly is.
