    <h1>The aviation phonetic alphabet</h1>

    <p>
      In aviation (and military contexts), the NATO phonetic alphabet
      is used to communicate letters clearly over radio,
      avoiding misunderstandings caused by noise, interference or accents.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Why does it exist?</h2>
    <p>
      Simply saying "B" or "D" over the radio can be dangerous:
      with background noise they may sound identical.
      The phonetic alphabet assigns a unique, recognizable word
      to each letter.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Why these specific words?</h2>
    <p>
      The words were chosen because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>they are understandable in many languages</li>
      <li>they have distinctive sounds</li>
      <li>they minimize confusion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">The full alphabet</h2>

    <p><strong>A - Alpha</strong>: chosen because it is a universal word, present in many languages.</p>
    <p><strong>B - Bravo</strong>: strong and clear sound, historically used in military contexts.</p>
    <p><strong>C - Charlie</strong>: common proper name, easy to recognize.</p>
    <p><strong>D - Delta</strong>: geographic/scientific term, internationally known.</p>
    <p><strong>E - Echo</strong>: short word with a sharp sound.</p>
    <p><strong>F - Foxtrot</strong>: famous dance, very distinctive phonetics.</p>
    <p><strong>G - Golf</strong>: globally known sport.</p>
    <p><strong>H - Hotel</strong>: same word in many languages.</p>
    <p><strong>I - India</strong>: universally known country.</p>
    <p><strong>J - Juliett</strong>: spelled with double T to avoid French pronunciation issues.</p>
    <p><strong>K - Kilo</strong>: international unit of measurement.</p>
    <p><strong>L - Lima</strong>: capital of Peru, clear pronunciation.</p>
    <p><strong>M - Mike</strong>: short and common name.</p>
    <p><strong>N - November</strong>: month of the year.</p>
    <p><strong>O - Oscar</strong>: well-known name.</p>
    <p><strong>P - Papa</strong>: universal word.</p>
    <p><strong>Q - Quebec</strong>: chosen because Q is rare and hard to distinguish.</p>
    <p><strong>R - Romeo</strong>: famous literary character.</p>
    <p><strong>S - Sierra</strong>: mountain range, clear sound.</p>
    <p><strong>T - Tango</strong>: well-known dance.</p>
    <p><strong>U - Uniform</strong>: international word.</p>
    <p><strong>V - Victor</strong>: symbol of victory, strong sound.</p>
    <p><strong>W - Whiskey</strong>: very recognizable word.</p>
    <p><strong>X - X-ray</strong>: scientific reference.</p>
    <p><strong>Y - Yankee</strong>: historical and cultural term.</p>
    <p><strong>Z - Zulu</strong>: African language reference, clear phonetics.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">History & curiosities</h2>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>
        The current NATO phonetic alphabet was officially adopted in 1956.
        However, it is the result of decades of experiments, failures and
        international collaboration.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
    <p>
      The need for a standardized phonetic alphabet emerged with the
      development of radio communications in the early 20th century.
      During World War I and II, different countries used different systems,
      often incompatible with each other.
    </p>

    <h3>Previous phonetic alphabets</h3>
    <p>
      Before the current system, several alphabets were used:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>RAF Alphabet (UK, 1920s)</strong>: Apple, Butter, Charlie...
        Easy for English speakers, but ineffective internationally.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>US Army/Navy Alphabet (WWII)</strong>: Able, Baker, Charlie...
        Widely used during World War II.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>APCO Alphabet (police)</strong>: Adam, Boy, Charles...
        Still used by some police forces today.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why were they replaced?</h3>
    <p>
      These systems were designed mainly for native English speakers.
      When used by non-native pilots or controllers, many words were
      mispronounced or misunderstood.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>
        For example, "Baker" pronounced with a strong French or Spanish accent
        could easily be confused with other words over radio.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>International collaboration</h3>
    <p>
      After World War II, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
      started linguistic studies to find words that could be:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>easily pronounced worldwide</li>
      <li>clearly distinguishable over radio</li>
      <li>resistant to noise and distortion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Thousands of tests were performed using pilots from different countries,
      speaking different native languages.
    </p>

    <h3>The role of NATO and ICAO</h3>
    <p>
      In 1956, ICAO and NATO jointly adopted the current alphabet:
      Alpha, Bravo, Charlie...
      It became the global standard for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>civil aviation</li>
      <li>military aviation</li>
      <li>maritime communications</li>
      <li>emergency services</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>
        Today, a pilot in Japan and a controller in Brazil use exactly
        the same phonetic system.
        This level of global standardization is extremely rare.
      </p>
    </div>


    <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>
          The NATO phonetic alphabet is not random:
          it is the result of linguistic studies and practical tests
          designed to maximize communication safety.
          In aviation, it can literally prevent accidents.
